# Tutorial Three

This tutorial is on how to plot and analyze residuals. The residuals from the previous tutorial will be saved into a csv file (lines added in the file [linear_regression.py](linear_regression.py) so you first need to run that code. After that, we will load the data from the csv file and plot the values (look at plot_residuals.py)

Additionally, we will talk about Recursive Feature Elimination, please look at the material and the example in this [link](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.html#sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.fit)

We will do the small example presented in the link.

Finally, we will start with Naive Bayes, please look at the link for the material and example: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html
